# project_poke
When learning about the Pokemon Universe, it's neccessary to understand that these creatures enjoy companionship and competition. They are organized in to several generations, and type categories that impact how they interact with one another.

For this project, we used the PokeAPI and a csv of Pokemon stats to build out a dashboard visualizing the composition of the Pokemon universe and how individual Pokemon may compare/interact with one another based on their basic stats and types.

To do this we used html, D3, JavaScript, JQuery, Plotly, and AnyChart JS to import the data and build dynamic visualization. 

This project was originally created in collaboration with fellow GitHub contributors danieljahnsen, kyle125t, kieranmcaleer, and akshetajain; I wish to share full credit with this team for the work on this endeavor.
