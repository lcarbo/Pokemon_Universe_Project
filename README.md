Project 2: Pokemon Data Analysis

For this project, we used the PokeAPI and a csv of Pokemon stats to build out a dashboard visualizing the composition of the Pokemon universe and how individual Pokemon may compare/interact with one another based on their basic stats and types.

To do this we used html, D3, JavaScript, JQuery, Plotly, and AnyChart JS to import the data and build dynamic visualization.
